- 👋 Hi, I’m @anikbak! I'm a grad student in Economics, and I study the linkages between technical change and labor markets. 
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the reasons why technical change in recent decades has seemingly affected skilled workers more than unskilled ones!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python in constructing dynamic macroeconomic models and for data analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a universal set of crosswalks across different systems of industry, occupation and geographical classifications. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at anikbak@stanford.edu!
