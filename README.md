- 👋 Hi, I’m @anikbak! I'm a research fellow in Economics, and I study the linkages between technical change and labor markets. 
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding how technical change affects labour markets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python in constructing dynamic macroeconomic models and for data analysis, and about the details underlying commonly used microdata in the US. I'm also learning how to incorporate AI/ML technologies into my workflows! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a universal set of crosswalks across different systems of industry, occupation and geographical classifications, as well as on understanding firm dynamics, innovation and the links between firm behavior and factor markets, which ultimately impacts inequality.
- 📫 How to reach me: Visit my [website](https://anikbak.github.io/)) or email me at [aniket.baksy@sussex.ac.uk](mailto:aniket.baksy@sussex.ac.uk)!
