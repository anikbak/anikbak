- 👋 Hi, I’m @anikbak! I'm a grad student in Economics, and I study the linkages between technical change and labor markets. 
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the reasons why technical change in recent decades has seemingly affected skilled workers more than unskilled ones!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python in constructing dynamic macroeconomic models and for data analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a universal set of crosswalks across different systems of industry, occupation and geographical classifications, as well as on understanding firm dynamics, innovation and the links between firm behavior and factor markets, which ultimately impacts inequality.
- 📫 How to reach me: Visit my [website](https://web.stanford.edu/~anikbak/) or email me at [anikbak@stanford.edu](anikbak@stanford.edu)!
